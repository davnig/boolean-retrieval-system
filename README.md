# Boolean Retrieval System

A simple Java implementation of a Boolean Retrieval System. This is the Project #1 of the Information Retrieval
university course.

## Project requirements

Write an IR system able to answer:

- Boolean queries with AND, OR and NOT;
- Wildcard and phrase queries;
- Provide a way to save and load the entire index from disk, to avoid re-indexing when the program starts;
- Some normalization or stemming can be performed;
- Spelling correction can be implemented;
- Evaluate the system on a set of test queries.

## Todo

- [x] Read corpus from a file
- [x] Normalization
- [ ] Indexing
- [ ] Save/load the index on/from a file
- [ ] Wildcard queries support
- [ ] Phrase queries support
